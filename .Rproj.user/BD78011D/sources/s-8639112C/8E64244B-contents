# Saint Lucia’s profile {#section4}

Saint Lucia is an island country in the Caribbean, part of the windward island chain of the eastern Caribbean region, located in the West Indies. It has a population of 186,629 people and a GDP of 1.617 billion as of 2020^[World Bank Data. (2020). St. Lucia. https://data.worldbank.org/country/st-lucia].St. Lucia first achieved a representative government in 1924 and an autonomous internal government as a member of the West Indian Federation until it achieved its independence in 1979, becoming a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth^[Tolson, R., Niddrie, D. L., & Momsen, J. D. (s. f.). Saint Lucia - History. Encyclopedia Britannica. https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Lucia/History ]. 


As a parliamentary democracy, the head of State is the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, who is represented in the country by the governor-general, appointed by the Queen. The head of the government lies with the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the majority party or majority coalition that wins the legislative elections; The legislative branch is made up of the House of Assembly, which has 17 members elected by universal suffrage for a period of five years, and the Senate, which has 11 members appointed by the governor-general. The two major political parties are the Saint Lucia Labour Party and the United Workers Party (UWP). 

Last general elections were held in July 2021 and resulted in a massive victory for the SLP, winning 13 over the 17 seats, while the UWP, who had been the party in power since 2016. 


These are the fourth consecutive elections in which the incumbent government loses to the opposition, however the country has long experienced peaceful transfers of power between the opposite parties^[Freedom House. (2021). St. Lucia Overview. https://freedomhouse.org/country/st-lucia/freedom-world/2021 ].

Some of the persistent challenges the country has faced in later years, include government corruption and inadequate transparency as well as a perception of impunity for abuses such as policy brutality and discrimination against minorities^[Freedom House. (2021). St. Lucia Overview. https://freedomhouse.org/country/st-lucia/freedom-world/2021 ].


Regarding the country’s foreign policy, St. Lucia is part of CARICOM and maintains close relations with the Caribbean countries, and countries with the greatest presence in the region, such as Venezuela, Cuba, Brazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Spain. It is also important to mention that St. Lucia traditionally has been one of the most active countries in advocating for the added value of Caribbean integration^[  Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de España. Ficha País Santa Lucía. http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Documents/FichasPais/SANTALUCIA_FICHA%20PAIS.pdf ].

## Saint Lucia RBM Profile


The government of Saint Lucia has made efforts to have a system in place where all its MDAs can generate and communicate reports on the most important aspects of planning and budgeting to decision-makers and thus improve the performance of the government. In this way, various frameworks have been created for strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation. However, there are still challenges in being able to coordinate monitoring, evaluation, and reporting efforts with those of planning and budgeting.
The planning process, both at the national level and at the MDA level, is clear and the relevant stakeholders and timeframes are identified^[  Saint Lucia´s planning is done in a mid-term basis (there is a Medium-term Development Strategy each triennium)]. Meanwhile, the budgeting process is inertial, that is, resources are systematically distributed to the same priorities and only based on their availability.

The activities and findings of a monitoring and evaluation system and RBM practices have not been able to contribute to improving budgeting and planning decision-making. However, there are efforts that have materialized into good practices within the government, such as the creation of the Project Monitoring Committee for each government project, which seeks to monitor the results of the programs based on the indicators that were raised from the moment of their design; the monitoring and evaluation reports requested from each project within the framework of the Medium-term Development Strategy; the preparation of budget reports based on the templates delivered by the Ministry of Finance where budget ceilings are established, the objectives of each MDA and the programs that seek to achieve those objectives and how it is aligned with national planning.


Despite the efforts by the government of Saint Lucia mentioned above regarding planning, budgeting, and performance management, there seem to be significant deficiencies in articulating them in order to better implement, evaluate, and improve policies, programmes, and projects. Regarding implementation, the government of Saint Lucia, as well as CARICOM Secretariat, are associated with a deficit in terms of policies, programs, projects, and processes (planning, budgeting, adjustments, etc.). This deficit can be seen through the progress rates of the implementation of programs, which are usually around 60% (or even lower), and whose terms of reference, plans and timeframes are often postponed, generating losses of resources and a lack of confidence of investors and donors in government. In addition, the deficit translates into a sharp decrease in the government's capacity to meet the demands of citizens, as well as the public problems that most afflict the country. In turn, the government's accountability and effectiveness undermine its position vis-a-vis the private, external sectors, and international aid. 


As mentioned before, having a whole-of-government RBM system in place and running will have effects on different processes, being planning and budgeting two of the most relevant ones. The government of Saint Lucia has clearly defined planning and budgeting processes (see Appendix C) that should be considered as the national RBM policy is developed; this will help identify specific needs and guide the RBM policy towards its use, privileging timeliness of the information generated. The overall national planning and budgeting processes are briefly explained below:


### National planning process

Saint Lucia´s planning process is consistent over time and identifies the times, resources and personnel necessary to carry it out. Saint Lucia´s planning is done in mid-term basis, and there is no long-term national development plan. However, government´s priorities will be given to the preparation of a Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) which will be the key element in terms of national planning (MTDS includes 6 main sectors: health, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, citizen security, and education.


There is a proposed investment to achieve these mid-term goals, the majority is oriented to health (46.6%) and infrastructure (39.5%). The Ministry of Economic Development, Housing, Urban Renewal, Transport, and Civil Aviation is responsible for national planning. As such, this Ministry plays a pivotal role in the coordination of development planning; mobilisation of public resources; and ensuring effective accountability for the use of such resources for the benefit of all stakeholders. 

A participatory approach should be employed in preparing the MTDS and NDP to ensure that the views and ideas of all stakeholders (public, private, NGOs, CBOs, civil society, academia, statutory organisations, etc.) are incorporated. This is essential to ensure ownership of the plan and successful implementation of the various strategies and actions. The MTDS and NDP should also inform the various strategies outlined in the strategic/sector plans of the various line agencies. Additionally, the various sector plans would serve as a guide for Agencies to develop and prioritise projects and programs, which would ultimately feed into the Government’s public sector investment programs and successive annual budget estimates^[Planning of Saint Lucia. https://observatorioplanificacion.cepal.org/en/planning-systems/planning-saint-lucia].


### National budgeting process^[The Citizen's Guide to the 2021-2022 budget. Ministry of Finance, Economic Growth, Job Creation, External Affairs and the Public Service. Consulted in: https://www.govt.lc/media.govt.lc/www/pressroom/news/attachments/the-citizen-s-guide-to-the-2021-2022-budget.pdf]

Saint Lucia's budgeting process consists of three main stages: 1. Budget planning and preparation; 2. Finalisation and 3. Budget implementation and monitoring. The stages are comprised as follow.

#### Budget planning and preparation

1.	The Ministry of Finance (MOF) prepares the Macroeconomic Outlook for the upcoming fiscal year where macroeconomic indicators are reviewed and projections for recurrent revenue, recurrent expenditure, and capital expenditure are formulated.

2.	A request/call for new initiatives for recurrent revenue, recurrent expenditure as well as capital expenditure are sent to ministries.

3.	The fiscal targets including economic indicators are established to determine revenue and expenditure projections, which aid in establishing overall spending limits for the new fiscal year.

4.	The MOF issues the Estimates Call. In this circular, the preliminary allocations are outlined as well as other requirements of the MOF.

5.	The Minister for Finance invites the private sector to submit inputs for the budget.

6.	The agencies submit their new initiatives. The MOF reviews the submission and prepares recommendations in consultation with agencies.

7.	Technical Budget Committee meetings are held with staff of the MOF and Department of Economic Development and Youth Economy to discuss recommendations, indicators and fiscal targets from the Budget Office, Debt Unit, Research Department and Department of Economic Development and Youth Economy. This committee then formulates recommendations and submits to the Budget Policy committee for approval through several iterations.

#### Finalisation

8.	After extensive reviews and dialogue the MOF present the draft estimates to the Minister for Finance.

9.	The Minister and Finance Officials meet with Cabinet to finalise the estimates.

10.	A second call circular is sent to the agencies communicating cabinet final approval of the Budget and changes required to be reflected in the estimates book, and any other relevant instructions.

11.	Following the Cabinet meeting, MOF prepares the printed estimates and develops the budget papers.

12.	The Ministry for Finance prepares and submits a draft appropriation bill to the Attorney General

13.	The Attorney General reviews the Appropriation Bill and prepares the Resolution.

14.	Minister for Finance tables the Resolution in the House of Parliament.

15.	Members of the Lower House debate the Estimates.

16.	The Appropriation Bill is tabled and debated.

17.	When passed the Appropriation Act is then assented to by the Governor-General and Gazetted.


#### Budget implementation and monitoring

18.	The MOF sends out a call to agencies to submit their expenditure request (recurrent expenditure, capital), revenue (actual and projections), and procurement plans on a quarterly basis.


19.	The MOF releases the allocation to agencies on a quarterly basis. The release of allocation is based in part on the current revenue performance and projections for the year. Capital expenditure allocation is determined based on the availability of the loan, grant, bond, or other fundraising and the status of the projects.


20.	Agencies are required to submit monthly revenue reports and quarterly performance reports to the MOF.


21.	The MOF is also required to produce and submit quarterly performance reports to the Minister for Finance.

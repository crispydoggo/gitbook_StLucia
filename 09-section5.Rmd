# Main findings {#section5}

As mentioned above, this Preparedness Diagnostic uses as a reference a four dimensions/bundles analysis, each one contains elements considered relevant to have an "Ideal RBM System". This Ideal RBM System serves as a benchmark that allow to compare the current situation in Saint Lucia in relation to the best possible scenario regarding practices, uses, and results of RBM. In this way, figure 5 shows the rate of progress that Saint Lucia has in each of the dimensions of analysis, with respect to the ideal scenario. 

The elements and sub-elements of the reference Ideal RBM System are not usually part of the status quo, they should be identified, designed and developed; following this, a country that has not considered adopting RBM practices would probably not comply or show advances in any of the analysed elements. In this sense, all the advances identified in this diagnosis represent valuable progress.

It is important to mention that, although there is a numerical value for each dimension, behind the numbers there was a qualitative analysis that determined the current situation of Saint Lucia regarding RBM. Furthermore, these "ratings" are in terms of the ideal scenario, so in no way does it represent an outright success or failure, but rather an approximation to the best possible situation of the RBM.

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("radar.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

data <- filter(radar, country == "Saint Lucia")

# To use the fmsb package, I have to add 2 lines to the dataframe: the max and min of each topic to show on the plot
  
data <- rbind(rep(100,4) , rep(0,4) , select(data, -country, -order))

```{r figure5, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Level of progress of the Ideal RBM System", out.width = '70%',fig.align = 'center'}
radar_rbm( data[1:3,], colors_border[2,], colors_in[2,], whole = TRUE )
```

Considering this rate of progress, a metric was built to progressively identify five levels of maturity of RBM systems. In this way, the data presented above are averaged and a graph is generated for all the dimensions and a graph that contains the average of the dimensions, identifying the level in which the country falls . The 5 levels are:

1.	Early initiatives
2.	Committed development
3.	RBM System
4.	Consolidated practices
5.	Mature State

For the case of Saint Lucia, the findings regarding the level of maturity of its RBM system are the following:

Saint Lucia is currently at the Early initiatives level. This occurs because even though the country has a few RBM tools and activities in place within the government, they are not articulated and regulated by any guideline, so they are also not incorporated in the planning and budgeting processes. 

However, as mentioned before, this does not mean that Saint Lucia's efforts will be dismissed in some way, but rather that we will be able to find the starting point to build a strong RBM system that considers the country's contextual factors so that Saint Lucia gets closer and closer to the ideal scenario.



##	Results by dimension 

The results of this diagnosis for each of the dimensions analysed (and their ideal elements) are presented below in a synthetic manner. For more detailed information on each dimension, elements, and sub-elements, please see [appendix B](#appendixB) and visit the interactive platform with all the disaggregated findings of this PD.

```

### Institutionalisation 

:::dim1
**Key Message:**
Saint Lucia has institutionalized planning and budgeting processes. Its medium-term planning has key results areas and these, in turn, have clear monitoring indicators, although they focus on outputs, not outcomes. However, the necessary mechanisms do not exist to formally establish who (relevant coordination and operation actors), how (methodologies) and when (timeframes) will carry out the M&E and RBM activities to improve decision-making and thus obtain the desired results. Therefore, there is not an integrated normative framework for RBM and M&E in the country.
:::

```{r , echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)


results <- read_excel("./Data/results.xlsx")

dim_1 <-  results %>% 
          filter( dimension_id == 1) %>% 
          select( -dimension, -dimension_id, -element_id ) 

kable(dim_1) %>%
          kable_paper("striped", full_width = T, font_size = 12) %>%
          column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
          column_spec(2, width = "33em")
          

```


### Execution Framework 

:::dim2
**Key Message:**
Saint Lucia has personnel dedicated to monitoring projects within the MDAs, such as the Project Monitoring Committee and the chief economists. However, these groups do not usually carry out monitoring and evaluation activities in a systematic way and are not coordinated or articulated with the planning, budgeting, and implementation processes to improve the results of the MDAs. In addition, in the MDAs there are no defined processes or specific resources allocated, nor a common language on M&E and RBM.
:::




```{r , echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
dim_1 <-  results %>% 
          filter( dimension_id == 2) %>% 
          select( -dimension, -dimension_id, -element_id ) 

kable(dim_1) %>%
          kable_paper("striped", full_width = T, font_size = 12) %>%
          column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
          column_spec(2, width = "33em")
          

```


### Technical capabilities


:::dim3
**Key Message:**
There is no sufficient offer (both private or public) or demand (from the government) for M&E services and capacity building in RBM within Saint Lucia. Also, there are no sufficient skilled personnel within the government with the capability to identify M&E needs and conduct M&E activities with the objective of orienting planning and budgeting towards results.
:::


```{r , echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

dim_1 <-  results %>% 
          filter( dimension_id == 3) %>% 
          select( -dimension, -dimension_id, -element_id ) 

kable(dim_1) %>%
          kable_paper("striped", full_width = T, font_size = 12) %>%
          column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
          column_spec(2, width = "33em")
          

```


### Use of evidence


:::dim4
**Key Message:**
Saint Lucia has planning and budgeting information publicly available, but not regarding government performance. Although there are efforts to monitor and use its results, such as the Project Monitoring Committee, there are just compliance-oriented and not results-oriented. As there are no evaluation activities, there is no use regarding evaluation findings/evidence. Also, a strategy to generate a culture of evidence use is not identified.
:::


```{r , echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

dim_1 <-  results %>% 
          filter( dimension_id == 4) %>% 
          select( -dimension, -dimension_id, -element_id ) 

kable(dim_1) %>%
          kable_paper("striped", full_width = T, font_size = 12) %>%
          column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
          column_spec(2, width = "33em")
          

```

##	Main challenges to strengthen the RBM system

As mentioned in [section 2.2](#section2), the development of an RBM System is a complex, nonlinear, and continuous process that must be contextualized in each country. In doing so, it is important to consider the main challenges that Dominica faces when it comes to strengthening its RBM system. This diagnosis identifies three major challenges:

1. Changing the culture and fostering the enabling environment to have an RBM system in place implies a change of mindset of public servants at all levels. It should be considered that throughout the process there must be a constant awareness/sensitization strategy, both in the short and medium term, that allows public servants to identify the importance to have this mindset change in pursuit of RBM. In other words, on a regular basis, there needs to be reminders on the importance of RBM and its impact on improving performance and lives of all citizens. 

2. Since this collaboration constitutes a whole-of-government approach, it is necessary to have a top-down commitment in which leaders and decision-makers demonstrate the benefits of the RBM system through evidence informed actions that are generated by the RBM system. This means that a top-down approach should be used demonstrate its usefulness of the information and evidence derived from the RBM system in improving the planning and budgeting decisions. Also, considering the whole-of-government approach, a coordination strategy that speaks to this scope should be prioritized to get the expected results and leave the silo approach behind.

3. For the RBM system to be sustainable, it is critical to generate a system of incentives and ensure that there is a balance between positive and negative incentives (such as potential penalties for non-compliance), to advance and sustain the system. The positive incentives can take different forms, from monetary to symbolic actions, such as the presentation of awards to staff and units and recognition for good performance in public service.

During the diagnosis it was mentioned several times that the scarcity of financial resources is a major impediment to the formalization of M&E and RBM activities. However, to start building an RBM system, it is important to be aware that public servants can receive benefits beyond monetary ones, such as recognition of their work within the public sector, whose ultimate value is improving the quality of life of the citizens.
